Foreword 
 
ﬁMoney is like manure. You have to 
spread it around or it smells.ﬂ  
- J. Paul Getty 
India is oneof the largest emerging markets in the worldwith enormous 
potential for growth in thecoming years. The financial market isalso 
expanding and attractingever-increasing numberof domestic and foreign 
investors. Efficient transfer of resour
ces from those having idle resources to 
otherswho have a pressing need fort
hem is achieved through financial 
markets. 
The func tioning of financial markets is  r
egulated by several legislations that 
include Acts, Rules, Regulations, Guide
lines, Circulars, etc. Understanding 
the legislations governing the financialma
rkets in India will give the reader 
a fair idea of how the financ ial markets in India areregulated. 
I am glad that theCommittee on Financ
ial marketsand Investors™ Protection 
of the Institute ofChartered Accoun tants 
of India isbringing out ‚A Guide on 
Laws applicable to Indian Financial Markets™. It covers the various 
legislations governing the financial ma
rkets in India. It aims to provide 
substantive and useful information to
 both a professional andcommon man. 
I take this opportunity tocongratulateCA. Rajkumar S.Adukia,Chairman 
and theentire team of Committee on 
Financial Markets and Investors™ 
Protection  for their initiatives and endeavours.

Preface 
 
"Financial peace isn't the acquisition of stuff. It's learning to live on 
less than you make, so you can give money back and have money to 
invest. You can't win until you do this."  
- Dave Ramsey 
Normally, a business enterprise needs finance for two purposes - for 
buying capital equipment and fixed assets, such as machinery, tools 

and implements, power plant, construction of factory building and 
workshops, etc.; which are referred to as long-term capital 
requirements, and for buying raw materials, holding the stock of 
finished goods, for payment of wages, etc., which are referred to as 
short-term capital requirements. Thus, an industrial house has to 
borrow short-term funds as well
 as long-term funds. The money-
market caters to the short-term needs only. The long-term capital 
needs are satisfied by the capital market. Thus the combination of 
both money market and capital market forms the financial market. 

The financial market covers the instruments and institutions which 
provide finance for short and long period. 
Financial markets provide channels for allocation of savings to 
investment. It provides a variety of assets to savers as well as 
various forms in which the investors can raise funds and thereby 
combine the acts of saving and investment. The savers and 
investors are constrained not by their individual abilities, but by the 
economy™s ability, to invest and save respectively. Thus, the financial 
markets contribute to economic development to the extent that the 

latter depends on the rates of savings and investment. 
It has been argued that strong legal systems foster development of 
sophisticated financial markets and intermediaries, which enhances 
the economy™s ability to manage risk and eventually lead to 
economic growth. The financial system of India which includes 
banking, capital, insurance, securities, foreign exchange etc. is 
characterized by several legislations for regulation and enforcement. 

Just like the developments and changes in financial markets are 

closely monitored, the regular changes in the financial laws of our 
country also need to be followed. This book gives a broad view of the 
legislations regulating the financial markets in India. 
I sincerely appreciate the efforts put in by 
Adv. Y. Rashmi Vinod 
 in 
preparing the publication. 
I would like to thank CA. Jay Ajit Chhaira, Vice-Chairman, CFMIP 
and all members of the CFMIP committee, CA Pankaj Inderchand 
Jain, CA Sanjeev Mah eswari, CA S Santhana Krishnan, CA Anuj 
Goyal, CA Naveen N.D. Gupta, CA Sharad Kabra, Shri Sidharth K. 
Birla, Shri Sunil Kanoria, CA Vikas Jain, CA Murmuria 

Bijay,CA.Shyam Lal Agarwal who have extended their support and 
encouragement in all committee activities. 
I would also like to thank all the persons who contributed towards 
finalizing this publication. 
I firmly believe that the publication will be helpful to all concerned.
